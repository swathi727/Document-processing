# Document-processing
. In this project I have tried implementing document processing using python language. Using this project one can insert text or number into document with ease and it even enables user to display full document to console or part of it by specifying the number of lines required by giving beginning and ending numbers. The user can also search for a string and get all occurrences of it with the line number where its present and can even find and replace any existing word with the new word, which will be reflected in the original file in matter of seconds. Overall this project enables features for user to insert ,display ,edit and search within the given document.
